In this talk, we look at two papers that comment on the cloud computing research field:

- The 7 Deadly Sins of Cloud Computing Research (HotCloud '12)
- Cloud-scale Resource Management (HotCloud '11)

By looking at these papers, we hope to:

- motivate our own work for the cloud research community
- improve our own experiments and papers (by avoiding the pitfalls or "sins")
- employ similar critiques when reviewing related work
