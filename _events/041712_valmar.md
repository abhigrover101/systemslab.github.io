David Bigelow will give a talk on his recent research.

Talk abstract: In an information-driven world, the ability to capture and store
data in real-time is of the utmost importance. The scope and intent of such data
capture, however, varies widely. Individuals record television programs for later
viewing, governments maintain vast sensor networks to warn against calamity,
scientists conduct experiments requiring immense data collection, and automated
monitoring tools supervise a host of processes which human hands rarely touch.
All such tasks have the same basic requirements -- guaranteed capture and analysis
of streaming real-time data -- but with greatly differing parameters. Our ability
to process and interpret data has grown faster than our ability to store and
manage it, which has led to the curious condition of being able to recognize
the potential importance of data without being able to store it, and hence
unable to later profit by it. This talk will discuss new methods and techniques
for storing and managing this class of data, including methods of guaranteeing
performance and maintaining quality of service requirements.
