This one-day symposium will provide an opportunity to learn about the research
of the SRL and ISSDM, interact with SRL and ISSDM faculty, graduate students,
and affiliated researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), and discuss
future directions and collaborative research projects at UCSC and LANL. The
traditional Oktoberfest barbeque and poster session will take place as part of
the symposium lunch break.

This year, the symposium will feature research on ongoing work in storage
systems, scalability, and systems performance management at SRL as well as
research in the ISSDM Collaborative Research Program.
