You are invited to the 3rd Annual UCSC Systems Research Lab (SRL) / Institute
for Scalable Scientific Data Management (ISSDM) Research Symposium to be held
at the Baskin School of Engineering (BSOE) at the University of California Santa
Cruz on October 18 â€“ 19, 2011.

The two-day Symposium will provide an opportunity to learn about the research
of the SRL and ISSDM, interact with SRL and ISSDM faculty, graduate students,
and affiliated researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), and discuss
future directions and collaborative research projects at UCSC and LANL.
In keeping with tradition, the UCSC Systems Oktoberfest will host its annual
Oktoberfest barbecue dinner on the evening of the first day of the symposium.

- Systems Research Day  (Tuesday, October 18) will focus on our research in
storage, scalability, and system performance management.  Presentations will
showcase the recent systems and storage research of the UCSC Systems Research
Laboratory (SRL) and the Institute for Scalable Scientific Data Management
(ISSDM).

- ISSDM Workshops Day  (Wednesday, October 19) will highlight research
in the ISSDM Collaborative Research Program, a collaboration between the UCSC
Jack Baskin School of Engineering (BSOE) and LANL. The program will be divided
into three focus areas: Cosmology, Human Computation and Knowledge Management.
