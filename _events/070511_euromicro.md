THEME AND TOPICS OF INTEREST

The twenty-third EUROMICRO Conference on Real-Time Systems (ECRTS’11)
is a forum aimed at covering state-of-the-art research and development
in real-time computing. Papers on all aspects of real-time systems are
welcome. These include, but are not limited to:

- APPLICATIONS: consumer electronics; multimedia and entertainment;
 process control; avionics, aerospace; automotive;
 telecommunications; cyber-physical systems.

- INFRASTRUCTURE AND HARDWARE: communication networks; embedded devices;
 hardware/software co-design; power-aware and other
 resource-constrained techniques; systems on chip; time engines and
 time synchronization; wireless sensor networks.

- SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES: compiler support; component-based approaches;
 middleware and distribution technologies; programming languages and
 operating systems.

- SYSTEM DESIGN AND ANALYSIS: modelling and formal methods;
 probabilistic analysis for RT systems; quality of service support;
 reliability, security and survivability in RT systems; scheduling
 and schedulability analysis; worst-case execution time analysis;
 validation techniques.

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Full papers must be submitted electronically through our web form in
PDF format (see "submission page" at http://ecrts11.ecrts.org).
Submitted papers must be unpublished and not under submission elsewhere.
Submissions must be in the same format as in the final published

CONFERENCE HIGHLIGTHS
---------------------

Pursuing a successful tradition in the ECRTS series, a special Work in
Progress (WiP) session will be organized.  This session is mainly
intended for presentation of on-going and recent work.  Additionally, a
set of Satellite Workshops focusing on hot topics will be
organized. These include the continuation of the already successful
Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) (the eleventh edition) and Operating Systems
Platforms for Embedded Real-Time Applications (OSPERT, the seventh edition)
Workshops and the second edition of RTSOPS, the Real-Time Scheduling Open
Problems Seminar. A separate call for papers will be issued later for both
WiP and satellite workshops. Please visit the website later for further information.

The main conference will include three Keynote Sessions, one per day,
which will be announced well in advance to the event.  In addition,
a Best Paper Award will given and a selection of best papers will
be invited for a special issue of an international journal.
