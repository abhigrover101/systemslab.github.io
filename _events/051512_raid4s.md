RAID4S uses an SSD to store parity in a RAID4 layout. Modthresh improves small
write performance by optimizing the RAID4 algorithm to more heavily utilize the
parity device. Initial experimentation showed promising results. We present
additional workload analysis for RAID4S and modthresh as well as results from
SPC's Financial1 trace replay.
