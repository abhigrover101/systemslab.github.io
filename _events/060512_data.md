Michael will be talking about hist work on virtualizing system resources for
big data processing. It will mainly reiterate the motivations and goals of the
project. There will also be a discussion of the initial steps that we've made
towards designing and implementing this new architecture.

The talk will touch on the current landscape of the available trace tools and
the reasons for choosing different trace tools for this project. LTTng-2.0 and
OProfile examples will be presented and analyzed to determine which events are
important and to collect information about these events.
