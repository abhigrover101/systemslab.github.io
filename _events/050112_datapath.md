We consider the problem of providing predictable performance to an
application-level workload consisting of many declarative queries with specific
response time latency tar- gets. At a low-level we use existing techniques that
provide predictable I/O performance, and avoid worst-case analysis by (1)
extracting performance requirements from the application workload, (2)
transforming these requirements onto the interface of the predictable I/O
sub-system, and (3) intelligently scheduling I/O for efficiency.
