The 32nd IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS) in Vienna, Austria will follow
the format of recent RTSSs, with three tracks beyond the main track. RTSS is the
premier conference in the area of real-time computing, presenting innovations in
the field with respect to theory and practice.

RTSS provides a forum for the presentation of high-quality, original research
covering all aspects of real-time systems design, analysis, implementation,
evaluation, and case-studies. RTSS'11 continues the trend of making RTSS an
expansive and inclusive symposium, looking to embrace new and emerging areas
of real-time systems research.

RTSS'11 welcomes the submission of mature papers in several areas of real-time
computing, including but not limited to scheduling; databases; observability;
composability; security for RTS; tools and reduction to practice; control and
adaptive RT systems theory; testing and debugging; modeling; formal methods;
communications (wireless, wireline, and sensor networks); power, thermal, and
energy management; embedded systems; sensor and implantable devices; fault
tolerance and robustness; intelligent behavior; time-sensitive robotics;
emergency/disaster management; embedded real-time systems and infrastructures;
QoS support; real-time systems middleware.

In addition to the main real-time track, this year we will continue with the
successful format of previous years with three specialized tracks on:
