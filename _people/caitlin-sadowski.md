Caitlin is a computer science Ph.D. candidate at UC Santa Cruz where she does research on
hard real-time multiprocessor scheduling with the SRL.

Outside of the SRL, her thesis is focused on making it easier to write correct,
high-performance code, with an emphasis on parallel programs. To that end, she is
currently researching the usability of different parallel and concurrent
programming concepts and course materials.
