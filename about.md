    <p>The Systems Research Lab (SRL) is part of the Jack Baskin School of Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The SRL is interested in a broad range of topics including real-time systems, performance management, and large-scale storage systems. We are particularly interested in the intersection of these topics, and in their application to problems requiring inter-disciplinary collaboration. The SRL is composed of a broad range of students and collaborators from industry, government research labs, and other universities.</p>
