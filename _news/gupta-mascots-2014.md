Abstract:

For three decades, Kryder’s Law correctly
predicted an exponential increase in bit density on disk
platters, leading to an exponential drop in cost per gigabyte.
However, disk now is over 7 times as expensive as it would
have been had Kryder’s law continued unchanged from
2010, and industry projections suggest that in 2020 the
gap will reach 200 times.
Entrenched expectations of the cost of storing data for
the long-term are being disrupted because of slow storage
density growth. We use an economic model of long-term
storage to investigate the implications of this disruption,
including a comparison of archives based upon traditional
disk media with alternative media such as flash. Our
model shows that archives based upon alternative media
are surprisingly cost competitive with archives based upon
traditional disk media over the long-term. We propose
using Archival Flash for long-term data preservation, with
the trade off between longer data retention period and lower write cycles.
