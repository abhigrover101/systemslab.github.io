The Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems (ECRTS) presented its 2010 Best
Paper award to Computer Science Ph.D. Students Greg Levin, Caitlin Sadowski and
Ian Pye, CS Professor Scott Brandt, and their collaborator Shelby Funk
(University of Georgia) for their work "DP-FAIR: A Simple Model for
Understanding Optimal Multiprocessor Scheduilng."

Multiprocessor systems are becoming commonplace as more computers have multiple
cores. Many implications of using a multiprocessor system, including scheduling
issues, are still not well understood. Multiprocessor scheduling is particularly
difficult in the presence of real-time constraints.  New research in the UCSC
Systems Research Laboratory (SRL) addresses this challenging problem.

A number of recent papers have used the notions of fluid scheduling and
deadline partitioning to guarantee optimality and improve performance. Levin et
al. provide a unifying theory and examine how it overcomes problems faced by
greedy scheduling algorithms. They discuss a simple DP-FAIR scheduling
algorithm, DP-WRAP, which serves as a least common ancestor to many recent
algorithms. They also show how to extend DP-FAIR to the scheduling sporadic
task sets with arbitrary deadlines.
