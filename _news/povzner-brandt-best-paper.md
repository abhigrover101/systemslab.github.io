The ACM International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing will
present its 2010 Best Paper award to Doctoral Candidate Povzner, Professor of
Computer Science Brandt, and collaborator Darren Sawyer for the work "Horizon:
Efficient Deadline-Driven Disk I/O Management for Distributed Storage Systems"
at the annual conference on June 23.

Data centers often consolidate a variety of workloads to increase storage
utilization and reduce management costs. Each workload has its own performance
targets that need to be met, requiring isolation from the effects of other
competing workloads sharing the system. Satisfying the global throughput and
latency targets of each workload is challenging in fully distributed storage
systems because workloads can have different data layouts and different requests
from the same workload can be serviced by different nodes. New research in the
UCSC Systems Research Laboratory (SRL) shows that a principled multi-layered
approach can deliver global throughput and latency targets while efficiently
utilizing system resources.

A paper on this research - "Horizon: Efficient Deadline-Driven Disk I/O
Management for Distributed Storage Systems" - by CS Ph.D. student Anna Povzner,
her advisor, CS Professor Scott Brandt, and their collaborator Darren Sawyer at
NetApp was just selected to receive the Best Paper Award at the ACM International
Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing (HPDC 2010), the premier
venue for presenting the latest research on the design, implementation,
evaluation, and use of parallel and distributed systems for high performance
and high end computing.
