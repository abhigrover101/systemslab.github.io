Computer Science Ph.D. student Greg Levin and Prof. Scott Brandt won the Best
Paper award at the 31st IEEE International Real-Time Systems Symposium
(RTSS 2011) for their groundbreaking work in multiprocessor real-time scheduling.
In collaboration with researchers in Brazil, Levin and Brandt developed RUN, an
optimal real-time multiprocessor scheduling algorithm that produces far fewer
preemptions and migrations than any other algorithm, greatly reducing runtime
overhead in multiprocessor real-time systems.
