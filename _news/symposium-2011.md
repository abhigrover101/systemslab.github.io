Attendees from four National Labs represented Los Alamos, Argonne, Lawrence
Livermore and NASA. In addition to UCSC, university participants included UC
Berkeley, the New Mexico Consortium, Josef Stefan Institute in Slovenia, Bauhaus
University in Weimar, Germany, and the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

The two-day symposium served as a forum for the exchange of ideas between UCSC
faculty and graduate students with researchers from industry and the national
labs. To foster the continuation of these exchanges and to encourage the forging
of new research collaborations, the Symposium presentations have been posted on
the website.  To view the Program Abstracts and presentation slides please go

Thank you for your ongoing support of the SRL and the ISSDM.  We look forward to
seeing you next year at the 4th Annual SRL/ISSDM Research Symposium.
